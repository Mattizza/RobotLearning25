See assignment document for instructions.

All the necessary code is available through ```pilot.ipynb```. N.B.: I forgot to upload the report in time because I pushed everything in a hurry. However, it was ready to go before the deadline and I am pushing it the next day with only few hours of delay, hope this is not a problem.
